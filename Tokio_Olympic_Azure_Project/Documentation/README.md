# Tokyo Olim√ßyc Game Project

On this project, we will try to develop an end-to-end project with some basic transformations. 
This will pass through each stage of an ingestion lifecycle.

**Brief summary:**

- Read files from a Data Source in CSV format.
- Create a Pipeline using Azure Data Factory to read the data from the source.
- Copy the data into a Storage Container (Raw Data).
- Transform the data with Azure Databricks.
- Copy the transformed data into the Storage Container (Transformed Data).
- Use Azure Synapse Analytics to create and copy the data to a database.
- Visualize and create dashboard indicators using Power BI.

To start with the project, we have to create a new Storage Account.
Choose a resource name and Storage Account Name.

After all set, create your Storage, and get into your Storage.

When it's all done, create your Container.

Create the folder that you will use in the ingestion.

Now you will have to copy the data to the container, using Azure Data Factory.
To do that, we have to create a Data Factory.
Select the resource name that you have created, and give it a name to the new Data Factory.

Once it's done, enter into your Data Factory that you have just created.

Now we start to build the Pipelines, to copy the data to the Storage Account.
